Scrum - Artifacts Workbook
Definition of Done 
Definition
	The definition of ‘done’ is a well-understood and clearly documented definition of items that must be established to mark a story (or iteration or project) to be complete. Getting a story to a completed state per the definition of done should be the goal of a team and should be used as the basis for planning. 
	Purpose
	* Assessment/Checklist allows work to be defined as “Done.”


* Defined by the development team.


* Varies per team: Understandable for the team.


* Helps to define how many items can be selected for Sprint.


* More mature teams: More stringent criteria.


	

Product Backlog
Definition
	The Product Backlog is used to document the wants and needs for “stuff,” which is prioritized by how much value it is to the business.
	Purpose
	* Different people in the business will ask for different “stuff.”
* Not everything that is asked for has value to the business.
* Some things may be valuable only to the person asking rather than to the entire business.
* By prioritizing value to the business, non-value add or less-value add items are eliminated or moved to the bottom of the list.
* The list is worked based on what the highest priority or value is to the business.




	Ordering
	* Ordered list of all user requests/requirements.


	Product Backlog  Grooming
	* Product Backlog is constantly re-evaluated and re-ordered, and items added or removed in a process are called Product Backlog Grooming.


	Large Items
	* Very large PBIs are called Epics.
   * Epics are broken down into smaller digestible chunks before being considered for work being done
	PBIs
	* Each entry is called a Product Backlog Item (PBI).


	



Sprint Backlog
Definition
	Is a subset of the product backlog that contains all the tasks and items the team commits to completing during a sprint.
Its essentially the “ to do list” for the sprint, owned and managed by the development team.
It evolves during the sprint as task are completed,added,or updated.
	Purpose
	1- provide focus : it clearly shows that the team will workon during the sprint.
2- enable transparency : everyone can see progress.
3- help planning and tracking : the team can manage work ,estimate effort,and track remaining tasks.
4- support delivery of value: it ensures the sprint delivers potentially shippable product increments.  
	Source of items
	Items in the sprint backlog come from the product backlog, which is the complete list of features, bug fixes, and improvements for the product.
The product owner prioritizes the product backlog based on business value,but the team selects what it can realistically complete in the sprint.
	How are items chosen?
	* Chosen based on the estimated amount of work required to complete.


* List of work for immediate execution.


* Pulled from Product Backlog.


* Chosen by the development team.


* Choose from the highest priority value.


* Only pull into sprint backlog the amount of work that the team believes they can reasonably accomplish successfully.


* Once chosen, the Sprint Backlog list is frozen — “nothing can be added” until this list is completed in the next time-box.


	What does value 
orientation vs. results orientation mean?
	Value orientation : focused on completing tasks or outputs, regardless of whether they deliver actual value.
In scrum, the focus should always be value orientation. Its better to deliver fewer,high-value features than many law impact tasks.
	Task Board
	Is a visual tool to track sprint progress.
* Interactive listing of work to be/being performed during Sprint.
* Used daily to identify workflow.
* Displayed in a common work area.


	Sprint Backlog Item
	Is a specific task or user story selected for the sprint.
	



  
Burndown Chart
Purpose
	* Shows remaining work in Sprint Backlog.


* Simple view of Sprint progress (daily).


* Assessed daily.


* Displayed in the common work area.
	How is it updated?
	Daily updates are typical, often during the daily scrum/stand-up meeting.
	How often is  it used?
	Daily usage : team looks at it every day to track progress.
	Significance?
	1- transparency.
2- early warning.
3- motivation.
4- process improvement.
	User Stories
  

Definition
	Is a short ,simple description of a feature from  the perspective of the end user.
Focuses on what the user wants and why, not technical details.
	

	Purpose
	1- capture requirements in a user-centred way
2- help the team understand and prioritize work.
3- facilitate discussion and planning .
	

	Format
	"As a <user type>, I want to <do some action> so that <desired result>.”


	

	Source
	1- comes from the product backlog.
2- created by the product owner ,often with input from stakeholders or users.
	

	Attributes for completeness
	* Independent
* Negotitatio
* Valuable
* Estimable
* Small
* Testable
	

	

Estimation


Story Points 
	Choosing enough work to fill up a full sprint:
* Based on relative effort.
* Show only the relative size of the item - not the time to complete.
* Teams pick a simple, agreed-upon basis.


 Used for Estimation Activities.




	Planning Poker
	Determining the amount of work for each
Product Backlog Item


Based on the Fibonacci Sequence:
* Each numbered card represents the amount of work the team member believes this item represents.
* Each development team member is issued one set of cards.
* If, when hands are shown, there is not a clear agreement on the amount of work involved, high and low bidders will explain why they chose that bid.
* The team will revote until they reach a consensus.
	Fibonacci  
Sequence
	The Fibonacci sequence is a type of series where each number is the sum of the two that precede it.  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
